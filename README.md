## **TASK 1: API INTEGRATION**

### **PROJECT TITLE:** WEATHER FORECAST WEB APPLICATION  


### **DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK**

As part of my internship with **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS** under the **Full Stack Web Development** domain, I completed **Task 1: API Integration**, where I developed a **Weather Forecast Web Application**. The goal of this task was to create a responsive and interactive webpage that fetches and displays real-time weather information using a **public Weather API**.  

This project demonstrates the concept of **API integration**, which allows web applications to interact with external data sources. The Weather App provides users with the ability to enter a city name and instantly view weather information such as **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions**. The data is fetched from the **OpenWeatherMap API**, processed using **JavaScript**, and displayed neatly on the user interface.  

The main purpose of this task was to understand how to make HTTP requests, handle JSON responses, manage asynchronous operations, and dynamically update web content using JavaScript. This project enhanced my practical understanding of API handling and front-end logic building.

### **OBJECTIVES**

- To learn how to **fetch data from a public API** using JavaScript.  
- To gain hands-on experience with **asynchronous programming** concepts such as `fetch()` and `async/await`.  
- To design and build a **user-friendly and responsive web interface**.  
- To dynamically display real-time weather data on the web page.  
- To implement **error handling** for invalid user inputs or failed API requests.

### **TECHNOLOGIES USED**

- **HTML5** – Structure of the webpage.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, responsiveness, and layout design.  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Fetching API data, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – Public weather API for live weather data.

### **WORKFLOW / IMPLEMENTATION**

1. **Project Setup:**  
   The project starts with setting up an HTML page containing a search box and a “Get Weather” button. The user can input a city name to retrieve its current weather information.  

2. **API Integration:**  
   I registered on **OpenWeatherMap** and obtained a free API key. This key is used to make API calls to fetch weather details based on the city name provided by the user.  

   Example API endpoint:
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}&appid={API key}&units=metric

    
3. **Fetching Data:**  
Using JavaScript’s `fetch()` method, a request is sent to the API endpoint. The response is received in JSON format and parsed to extract weather-related data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition description.  

4. **Dynamic Display:**  
The data is displayed dynamically on the webpage using **DOM manipulation**. When the user searches for another city, the data updates automatically without reloading the page.  

5. **Error Handling:**  
If an invalid city is entered or there is an issue with fetching data, the app displays a friendly error message to inform the user.  

6. **Styling and Responsiveness:**  
The application is styled using CSS to create a clean, modern look with gradient backgrounds and smooth transitions. It is also responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes like mobile, tablet, and desktop.  

7. **Testing and Validation:**  
The app was tested using multiple city names to ensure the accuracy of results and smooth user interaction.

### **OUTPUT**

The final **Weather App** allows users to:  
- Enter any **city name**.  
- View **real-time weather data** including:  
- 🌡️ Temperature (in Celsius)  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 🌬️ Wind Speed  
- ☁️ Weather Condition Description  

The app provides instant and accurate results by communicating with the OpenWeatherMap API in real time. The interface is interactive, minimalistic, and easy to use.

### **KEY LEARNINGS**

- Understood the concept and importance of **API integration** in web development.  
- Learned how to make **HTTP requests** and process **JSON responses** using JavaScript.  
- Gained practical experience with **asynchronous programming** (`fetch()`, Promises, and async/await`).  
- Improved front-end development skills by working with **dynamic DOM updates** and **responsive layouts**.  
- Understood how to handle **errors and exceptions** effectively while dealing with real-world APIs.  

---

### **CONCLUSION**

The **Weather Forecast Web Application** successfully demonstrates how to fetch and display live data from an external API. Through this project, I learned to connect a frontend interface with a real-time data source, handle responses, and display information dynamically.  

This task was an excellent introduction to **API integration** and gave me valuable experience that can be applied to more complex applications like news dashboards, stock trackers, and data-driven web apps. It improved my problem-solving skills, JavaScript proficiency, and understanding of how real-time web applications work.  

This project marks the successful completion of **Task 1 (API Integration)** under my **Front-End Development Internship** at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**.
